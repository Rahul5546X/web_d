### server actions###
```
Server Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.
```

```
suppose we have a form and we want to submit the data to our server so we have to use api to submit the data (client-side components, handle-submit function)
```

### with help of server actions(looks like php)
```
Everything happens just in one file front end backend

man lo hmare pass ek form h name address leta h 
jaise hi hm submit pr click krenge page reload hoga to page reload hoga aur url kuch esi ho jayegi
http://localhost:3000/?name=value&add=india
```
``` to maintain all the server actions create a actions folder and maintain all the actions there
```
