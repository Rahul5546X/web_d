// solved a project on random colors generator and stop with js and set timeinterval and clear timeinterval
// got lazy didn't do much
// also learned how to get the data from the api using the old methods(before fetch) using htttp request then setting the states and using open and send function
// to learn syntax i'll have to watch the video once again and make a simple project
