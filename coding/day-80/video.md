Hello everyone! Today, our topic is the difference between pb and sb companies.

pb companies deal with physical products or tangible goods, while sb companies offer services to their clients. However, in the IT field, it's a bit different. Let's take Microsoft as an example. Microsoft is considered a pb company, but you can't physically touch their main product: the Windows operating system.

"In the IT field, pb companies are those that develop their own products from scratch and sell them. On the other hand, sb companies sell their services. Let's continue with the example of banks. Banks excel in handling finances, but they do not specialize in creating apps and websites. So, they often outsource these tasks to sb companies according to their needs."

In pb companies, there's typically less interaction between developers and end-users. However, in sb companies, there's more interaction between developers and clients. Clients can easily request changes to their product based on their needs.

pb companies don't create products for individual users, but sb companies provide services tailored to the needs of their clients.

The main source of income for pb companies is selling products, whether digital or physical. For sb companies, income comes from contracts or hourly rates for customer services.

In pb companies, there's a focus on lifelong learning. In sb companies, developers must adapt to changing client needs.
