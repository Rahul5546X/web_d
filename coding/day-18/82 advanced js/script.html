    <h1>Advanced Javascript concepts</h1>
    <ul><li>IIFE(immediately invoke fnction expression) <p>It is a function that runs as soon as it is defined </p>
    </li>
    <li>Destructuring <p>used to unpack values from an array, or  properties from objects, into distinct variables. // always use three dots...</p>
    </li>
    <li>Spread <p>// always use three dots... </p>
    </li>
    <li>Hoisting <p>Only applicable if a variable is defined using var. Does not work in the case of const and let </p>
        <p>
            console.log(w)
            <p>var w = 6; 
                in this case declaration will get at the top of the block(just the declaration (var w)not it's value i.e var w = 6 so it'll show undefined)</p>
            
// functions also supports hoisting if they are declared without using const
        </p>
    </li></ul>
