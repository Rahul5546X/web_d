    <h2>Today we will learn about ID and Classes</h2>

    <!-- id can not be same -- aadhar card, driving license etc.
    suppose two friends are there they are very good friend they share everything but there adhar number can not be same ever.
    We can uniquely identify them with there id(it is an unique identifier)

    there class(school vali ni) can be same,a person can has multiple classes, and a class can also have multiple elements 
    class can be same in two or more than two elements

    basically id and classes are attributes of an element
    id also used in linking(kisi link ke aage # lgakr likho fir dekho)
    -->

    <div id = "first div" class="red bg-yellow">first</div>
    <div id = "second div"> second </div>
